# CS50w Project-3 Mail

This is the project 3 of the course CS50w in which I designed a front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails.

# Specification

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, complete the implementation of your single-page-app email client. You must fulfill the following requirements:

- Send Mail: When a user submits the email composition form, add JavaScript code to actually send the email.

  - You’ll likely want to make a POST request to /emails, passing in values for recipients, subject, and body.
  - Once the email has been sent, load the user’s sent mailbox.
    
- Mailbox: When a user visits their Inbox, Sent mailbox, or Archive, load the appropriate mailbox.

  - You’ll likely want to make a GET request to /emails/<mailbox> to request the emails for a particular mailbox.
  - When a mailbox is visited, the application should first query the API for the latest emails in that mailbox.
  - When a mailbox is visited, the name of the mailbox should appear at the top of the page (this part is done for you).
  - Each email should then be rendered in its own box (e.g. as a <div> with a border) that displays who the email is from, what the subject line is, and the      timestamp of the email.
  - If the email is unread, it should appear with a white background. If the email has been read, it should appear with a gray background.
  
- View Email: When a user clicks on an email, the user should be taken to a view where they see the content of that email.

  - You’ll likely want to make a GET request to /emails/<email_id> to request the email.
  - Your application should show the email’s sender, recipients, subject, timestamp, and body.
  - You’ll likely want to add an additional div to inbox.html (in addition to emails-view and compose-view) for displaying the email. Be sure to update your code to hide and show the right views when navigation options are clicked.
  - See the hint in the Hints section about how to add an event listener to an HTML element that you’ve added to the DOM.
  - Once the email has been clicked on, you should mark the email as read. Recall that you can send a PUT request to /emails/<email_id> to update whether an email is read or not.

- Archive and Unarchive: Allow users to archive and unarchive emails that they have received.

  - When viewing an Inbox email, the user should be presented with a button that lets them archive the email. When viewing an Archive email, the user should be presented with a button that lets them unarchive the email. This requirement does not apply to emails in the Sent mailbox.
  - Recall that you can send a PUT request to /emails/<email_id> to mark an email as archived or unarchived.
  - Once an email has been archived or unarchived, load the user’s inbox.

- Reply: Allow users to reply to an email.

  - When viewing an email, the user should be presented with a “Reply” button that lets them reply to the email.
  - When the user clicks the “Reply” button, they should be taken to the email composition form.
  - Pre-fill the composition form with the recipient field set to whoever sent the original email.
  - Pre-fill the subject line. If the original email had a subject line of foo, the new subject line should be Re: foo. (If the subject line already begins with Re: , no need to add it again.)
  - Pre-fill the body of the email with a line like "On Jan 1 2020, 12:00 AM foo@example.com wrote:" followed by the original text of the email.
